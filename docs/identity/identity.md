## Summary of IAM Entities

## Roles & STS

- Roles use AWS STS to retrieve credentials and impersonate the IAM role the principal has access to.
- Temporary credentials can be valid between 15 minutes to 12 hours.
- Assume Role to an IAM User:
  - Explicitly grant your users permission  to assume the role.
  - Users must switch to the this role using Console (or) AWS CLI (or) AWS API
  - Additional protection: Mandate MFA for assuming the role, for extra security.

> Important:  When you assume a role, you give up your current permissions and temporarily take on a new role (with corresponding permissions).

### Cross-account access
- **Resource owner account**: Create a role in the resource owner account (i.e the account where the resource resides), and provide permission to requester account root, the required access.
  - Trust Policy: Establishes trust relationship to another account. Trust policy establishes _who_.
  - Permissions: Describes what is allowed when this role is assumed. Permissions establishes _what_.
- **Requester account**: Provide _permissions_ to the users or group or role to assume this *cross-account role* that is created in the resource owner account.
- **Providing access to aws accounts owned by third-parties**:
  - The 3rd party aws account id is required.
	- Add External ID - secret between you and the 3rd party. It helps to handle *confused deputy* problem.
	- Define permissions in the IAM Policy

## IAM Permission Boundary
- IAM Permission Boundaries are supported for users and roles (not groups)
- Advanced feature to use a managed policy to set the maximum permissions an IAM entity can get. 
- When you set a permissions boundary for an entity, the entity can perform only the actions that are allowed by both its identity-based policies and its permissions boundaries.
- Example: Permission boundary allows only s3:* and ec2:*, if policy allows iam:*, then nothing is allowed!

> NOTE: Permission boundary limits the permissions (i.e. acts as an upper boundary) but does not provide permission on it's own.

## Session Policies
- Session policies are advanced policies that you pass as a parameter when you programmatically create a temporary session for a role or federated user. 
- The permissions for a session come from the IAM entity (user or role) used to create the session and from the session policy. 
- The entity's identity-based policy permissions are limited by the session policy and the permissions boundary. 
- The effective permissions for this set of policy types are the intersection of all three policy types.

## AWS Organizations
- Prevent any non - compliant tagging operations on specified services and resources
- Generate a report that lists all tagged/non - compliant resources
- IAM Policy evaluation logic: 
	- Evaluate explicit deny
	- Organizations SCPs
	- Resource - based Policies
	- IAM Permissions Boundaries
	- Session Policies
	- Identity - based Policies
- Control Tower
	- Uses Service Catalog to provision new aws accounts
	- Guardrails: Preventive using SCP. Detective using AWS Config.
	- Example: Detect untagged resources and report them.
- Resources Access Manager  (RAM)
	- Allow sharing of resources
	- Cannot share security groups and default VPC. Security groups from other accounts can be referenced for maximum security.
	- AWS Network firewall policies can be shared.
	- EC2 (Dedicated Hosts, Capacity Reservation)
	- Aurora DB Clusters can be shared. 
	- All accounts must belong to the same organization

## Deep Dive:

### Roles vs. Resource-based Policy
- When you assume a role (user, application or service), **you give up your original permissions** and take the permissions assigned to the role.
- When using a resource-based policy, the principal doesnâ€™t have to give up any permissions.

### Resource vs. Identity Policies
- Resource policies are inline only, not managed.
- If there is a deny in either of identity or resource policies, the action is denied, otherwise allowed, provided the resource is within an aws account
- For cross-account, the action must be allowed in both the accounts.

### Effect of resource based policies, identity policies and permissions boundary:

- Resource-based policies that specify the user or role as the principal are not limited by the permissions boundary.

*Resource-based policies for IAM users:*
> Within the same account, resource-based policies that grant permissions to an IAM user ARN (that is not a federated user session) **are not limited by an implicit deny in an identity-based policy or permissions boundary**.

*Resource-based policies for IAM Roles:*
> Resource-based policies that grant permissions to an IAM role ARN **are limited by an implicit deny in a permissions boundary or session policy**
> Within the same account, resource-based policies that grant permissions to an IAM role session ARN grant permissions directly to the assumed role session. Permissions granted directly to a session are not limited by an implicit deny in an identity-based policy, a permissions boundary, or session policy. 

*Resource-based policies for IAM federated user sessions*
> Resource-based policies that grant Permissions directly to a session are not limited by an implicit deny in an identity-based policy, a permissions boundary, or session policy.
> However, if a resource-based policy grants permission to the ARN of the IAM user who federated, then requests made by the federated user during the session are limited by an implicit deny in a permission boundary or session policy.

- Depending on the type of principal, an Allow in a resource-based policy can result in a final decision of Allow , even if an implicit deny in an identity-based policy, permissions boundary, or session policy is present. 
- This is different than the way that other policies impact policy evaluation.
- For example, policy evaluation differs when the principal specified in the resource-based policy is that of an IAM user, an IAM role, or a session principal. 
- Session principals include IAM role sessions or an IAM federated user session. 
- If a resource-based policy grants permission directly to the IAM user or the session principal that is making the request, then an implicit deny in an identity-based policy, a permissions boundary, or a session policy does not impact the final decision.

## Scenarios:

### Third-party access to aws services:

#### Question:
Scenario: For example, let's say that you decide to hire a third-party company called Example Corp to monitor your AWS account and help optimize costs. In order to track your daily spending, 
Example Corp needs to access your AWS resources. Example Corp also monitors many other AWS accounts for other customers.
**How will you provide access to Example Corp?**

#### Answer:
Do not give Example Corp access to an IAM user and its long-term credentials in your AWS account. Instead, use an IAM role and its temporary security credentials. An IAM role provides a mechanism to allow a third party to access your AWS resources without needing to share long-term credentials (for example, an IAM user's access key).
**Include External ID in the Trust Policy**

```
{
  "Principal": {"AWS": "Example Corp's AWS Account ID"},
  "Condition": {"StringEquals": {"sts:ExternalId": "Unique ID Assigned by Example Corp"}}
}  
```    

## Best Practices
- Use least privilege for maximum security.
- _Access Advisor_: See permissions granted and when last accessed.
- _Access Analyzer_: Analyze resources that are shared with external entity.
