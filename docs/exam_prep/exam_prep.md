## General Strategies
1. Read both the question and the answer in full at least once.
2. Identify text in the question that implies certain AWS features—for example, “data retrieval times.”
3. Identify the features mentioned in the answers.
4. Pay attention to qualifying clauses. For example, clauses like “in the most cost-effective way” and “will best fulfill” may eliminate certain answers.
5. Eliminate obviously wrong answers to narrow the selection of possible right answers.
