# Advanced Networking

## ENI

- An elastic network interface is a logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card. It includes one primary IPV4 and multiple secondary IPV4 addresses.
- You cannot detach a primary network interface from an instance. 
- You can create and attach additional network interfaces. 
- The maximum number of network interfaces that you can use varies by instance type.

## Centralized Egress

- NAT gateway is a managed network address translation service. 
- Deploying a NAT gateway in every spoke VPC can become cost prohibitive because you pay an hourly charge for every NAT gateway you deploy, so centralizing it could be a viable option. 
- To centralize, you create a separate egress VPC in the network services account and route all egress traï¬ƒc from the spoke VPCs via a NAT gateway sitting in this VPC using Transit Gateway.

## Hybrid Connectivity

### One-to-one connectivity

- In this setup, a VPN connection and/or Direct Connect private VIF is created for every VPC. 
- This is accomplished by using the virtual private gateway (VGW). 
- This option is great for small numbers of VPCs, but as a customer scales their VPCs, managing hybrid connectivity per VPC can become difficult.

### Edge consolidation
- In this setup, customers consolidate hybrid IT connectivity for multiple VPCs at a single endpoint. 
- All the VPCs share these hybrid connections. 
- This is accomplished by using **AWS Transit Gateway and the Direct Connect Gateway**.
