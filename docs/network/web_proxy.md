# Web Proxy

Limit outbound web connections from your VPC to the internet, using a web proxy with custom domain whitelists or DNS content filtering services. The solution is scalable, highly available, and deploys in a fully automated way.

> A forward proxy server acts as an intermediary for requests from internal users and servers, often caching content to speed up subsequent requests. Companies usually implement proxy solutions to provide URL and web content filtering, IDS/IPS, data loss prevention, monitoring, and advanced threat protection.
