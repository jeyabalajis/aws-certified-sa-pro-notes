# AppSync

- With managed GraphQL subscriptions, AWS AppSync can push real-time data updates over Websockets to millions of clients. 
- For mobile and web applications, AppSync also provides local data access when devices go offline, and data synchronization with customizable conflict resolution, when they are back online.
- AppSync supports real-time chat applications. 
- You can build conversational mobile or web applications that support multiple private chat rooms, offer access to conversation history, and queue outbound messages, even when a device is offline.

> AppSync allows to easily make any of its supported data sources real-time, with connection management, scaling, fan-out and data broadcasting handled automatically between the service and the clients, enabling developers to focus on the business differentiators for their real-time applications instead of WebSockets operations and infrastructure management.
