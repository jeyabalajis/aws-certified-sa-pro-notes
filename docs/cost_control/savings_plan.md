# Savings Plan

 > Savings Plans ia a new and flexible discount model that provides you with the same discounts as Reserved Instances, in exchange for a commitment to use a specific amount (measured in dollars per hour) of compute power over a one or three year period.

AWS offers three types of Savings Plans:

- Compute Savings Plans. Compute Savings Plans apply to usage across Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, and AWS Fargate.
- EC2 Instance Savings Plans. The EC2 Instance Savings Plans apply to EC2 usage.
- Amazon SageMaker Savings Plans. Amazon SageMaker Savings Plans apply to Amazon SageMaker usage.

> You can easily sign up a 1- or 3-year term Savings Plans in AWS Cost Explorer and manage your plans by taking advantage of recommendations, performance reporting, and budget alerts.

> Note that Savings Plans does not provide a capacity reservation. You can however reserve capacity with On Demand Capacity Reservations and pay lower prices on them with Savings Plans.

> You can continue purchasing RIs to maintain compatibility with your existing cost management processes, and your RIs will work along-side Savings Plans to reduce your overall bill. _However, as your RIs expire we encourage you to sign up for Savings Plans as they offer the same savings as RIs, but with additional flexibility_.

## Reserved Instances

- When you purchase a Reserved Instance in a specific Availability Zone, it provides a capacity reservation. 
- This improves the likelihood that the compute capacity you need is available in a specific Availability Zone when you need it. 
- Payment options: No upfront, Partial upfront, full upfront.
