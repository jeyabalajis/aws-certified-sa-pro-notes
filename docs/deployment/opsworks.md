# OpsWorks

## OpsWorks Stacks

> AWS OpsWorks Stacks is an application and server management service. With OpsWorks Stacks, 
>you can model your application as a stack containing different layers, such as load balancing, database, and application server. 
>Within each layer, you can provision Amazon EC2 instances, enable automatic scaling, and configure your instances 
>with Chef recipes using Chef Solo. This allows you to automate tasks such as installing packages and programming 
>languages or frameworks, configuring software, and more.


## Best Practices

> For preparation work (like VPC, NAT etc.), it is okay to use CloudFormation. For dynamic workloads (EC2), OpsWorks is preferred.
